    id: 1,
    title: "bind(), call(), vs apply() (Complete Guide)",
    category: "JavaScript Core",
    explanation:
      "All three methods are used to explicitly set 'this' inside a function.\n\n## Basic Summary\n* **.call(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...):** Calls the function immediately; arguments are passed individually.\n* **.apply(thisArg, [arg1, arg2, ...]):** Calls the function immediately; arguments are passed as an array.\n* **.bind(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...):** **Does NOT call immediately**; it returns a **NEW function** permanently bound to the specified 'this' context, which must be executed later.\n\n## Execution & Return Value\n`call()` and `apply()` execute the function and return the function's result immediately. `bind()` returns a new, bound function.",
    tips: '"Interview Tips / Pitfalls"\n* **Key takeaway:** `call()` and `apply()` execute immediately (temporary binding); `bind()` returns a new function (permanent binding).\n* Use `apply()` when you have an array of arguments (e.g., using `Math.max.apply(null, array)`).\n* Use `bind()` for event callbacks, function composition, and partial application (pre-setting arguments).\n* Arrow functions ignore all three methods for the `this` context because they capture `this` lexically.',
    codeString:
      'function greet(greeting, city, country) {\n  return greeting + \', \' + this.name + \' from \' + city + \', \' + country;\n}\nconst person = { name: "Jay" };\nconst alice = { name: \'Alice\' };\n\n// 1. call(): immediate execution, args individually\nconsole.log(greet.call(person, \'Hello\', "Hyderabad", "India"));\n\n// 2. apply(): immediate execution, args as an array\nconsole.log(greet.apply(alice, ["Hi", "Bangalore", "India"]));\n\n// 3. bind(): returns a new function (supports partial application)\nconst boundGreet = greet.bind(person, "Yo", "New York");\nconsole.log(boundGreet("USA")); // Execute the bound function later\n',

  {
    id: 7,
    title: "Closures — explanation and example",
    category: "JavaScript Core",

    explanation:
      "A **closure** is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (its **lexical environment**).\n\nIn simple terms, a function forms a closure by retaining access to variables from its parent scope, even after the parent function has finished executing. Closures are powerful for achieving **data privacy** (encapsulation) and creating **function factories**.\n",
    tips: '"Interview Tips / Pitfalls"\n* Explain **memory considerations**: closures keep the referenced variables alive in memory, which can lead to memory leaks if not handled correctly (though modern JS engines are good at garbage collection).\n* Mention surprising behaviors in loops and closures, especially with `var` (which is function-scoped) versus `let` or `const` (which are block-scoped).\n',
    codeString:
      "function makeCounter(start = 0) {\n  // 'count' is part of the closure's lexical environment\n  let count = start;\n\n  return {\n    increment: () => ++count,\n    decrement: () => --count,\n    value: () => count\n  };\n}\n\nconst c = makeCounter(10);\nconsole.log(\"Initial:\", c.value());\nc.increment();\nconsole.log(\"After Increment:\", c.value());\n// The 'count' variable remains private and encapsulated.\n",

  // Q8: Hoisting
  {
    id: 8,
    title: "Hoisting (var vs let/const, function declarations)",
    category: "JavaScript Core",

    explanation:
      "**Hoisting** is the JavaScript engine's behavior of moving declarations to the top of their current scope during the compilation phase.\n\n* **`var` and Function Declarations:** The declaration is hoisted to the top. `var` variables are initialized to `undefined`. Function declarations are hoisted completely (name and body).\n* **`let` and `const`:** These are also hoisted, but they are placed in the **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)** from the start of the block until their declaration is processed. Accessing them in the TDZ results in a `ReferenceError`.\n",
    tips: '"Interview Tips / Pitfalls"\n* **TDZ:** Explain that `let/const` are hoisted but inaccessible, leading to a `ReferenceError`, which is better than the confusing `undefined` you get with `var`.\n* **Function Differences:** Function declarations are fully hoisted and can be called before they appear in the code, whereas function expressions (assigned to `var`, `let`, or `const`) behave like regular variables and are only partially hoisted.\n',
    codeString:
      '// 1. var hoisting\nconsole.log("A is:", a); // Output: undefined\nvar a = 2;\n\n// 2. let/const and TDZ\ntry {\n  console.log("B is:", b);\n} catch (e) {\n  console.log("B is:", e.name); // Output: ReferenceError\n}\nlet b = 3;\n\n// 3.

  // Q10: Spread vs Rest operator
  {
    id: 10,
    title: "Spread vs Rest Operator (`...`)",
    category: "JavaScript Core",

    explanation:
      "Both use the `...` syntax, but their function is opposite based on context:\n\n| Operator | Context | Action | Result |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Spread** | Function call, array literal, object literal | **Expands** an iterable into its individual elements. | Copies elements/properties. |\n| **Rest** | Function parameters, array/object destructuring | **Collects** the remaining individual elements into a new array or object. | Bundles elements/properties. |\n",
    tips: '"Interview Tips / Pitfalls"\n* **Shallow Copy:** Both operators create a shallow copy. Nested objects or arrays will still share the same references.\n* **Rest Position:** The rest operator must always be the **last element** in the array destructuring or function parameters.\n',
    codeString:
      "// 1. Spread Operator (Expands)\nconst arr1 = [1, 2];\nconst arr2 = [...arr1, 3, 4]; // [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n// 2.

  }, // Q30: JavaScript variable scope
  {
    id: 30,
    title: "JavaScript Variable Scope (Global, Function, Block)",
    category: "JavaScript Core",

    explanation:
      "Scope defines the visibility and accessibility of variables.\n\n| Scope Type | Variables | Behavior |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Global** | Declared outside functions/blocks | Accessible everywhere. |\n| **Function** | `var` declared inside function | Accessible throughout the entire function body (including nested blocks). |\n| **Block** | `let` / `const` declared inside `{}` | Accessible only within the surrounding block (`if`, `for`, regular blocks). |\n\n**Lexical Scoping:** Variables are resolved based on where they are defined (written in the source code), not where they are called. This is the foundation of closures.\n",
    tips: '"Interview Tips / Pitfalls"\n* **`var` Leakage:** Demonstrate how a `var` declared inside an `if` block is still available outside the block but inside the function scope. This behavior is why `let` and `const` (block-scoped) are preferred in modern JS.\n',

  {
    id: 31,
    title: "Key ES6+ (ECMAScript 2015) Features",
    category: "JavaScript Core",

    explanation:
      "ES6 introduced major changes that fundamentally improved JavaScript syntax, readability, and capabilities:\n\n* **Variable Declarations:** `let` and `const` (block-scoped).\n* **Functions:** Arrow functions (lexical `this`, cleaner syntax).\n* **Collections:** `Map` and `Set` data structures.\n* **Async:** Promises (standardized async behavior).\n* **Syntax:** Template literals, Default parameters, Destructuring (array/object).\n* **Iterables:** Rest/Spread operator, `for...of` loops.\n* **OOP:** Classes (`class`, `extends`, `super`).\n* **Modularity:** Modules (`import` and `export`).\n",
    tips: '"Interview Tips / Pitfalls"\n* Mention that despite the new syntax, JS Classes are still built on the existing **prototypal inheritance** mechanism.\n* Discuss the need for **transpilation** (using tools like Babel) to convert modern ES6+ code into older ES5 for better browser compatibility.\n',

    category: "JavaScript Core",

    explanation:
      "ES6 `class` syntax provides a cleaner way to implement object-oriented patterns, specifically **prototypal inheritance**.\n\n* **`constructor`:** Initializes the instance properties when a new object is created via `new ClassName()`.\n* **Methods:** Methods defined inside the class body are placed on the object's prototype, saving memory compared to defining a function on every instance.\n",
    tips: '"Interview Tips / Pitfalls"\n* Mention that modern JavaScript supports **private fields** using the `#` symbol (e.g., `#fuel`), which genuinely enforces encapsulation at the language level.\n* Discuss the importance of the `super()` call in the constructor of a derived class (`extends`).\n',
    codeString:

    explanation:
      "JavaScript supports both paradigms.\n\n| Paradigm | Focus | Key Principles | Trade-offs |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **OOP** | Objects and mutable state. | Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism. | Maps well to domain models; state changes can be complex to track. |\n| **FP** | Pure functions and data flow. | Pure functions, Immutability, Function Composition. | Easier to test, predict, and parallelize; less natural for stateful entities. |\n",
    tips: '"Interview Tips / Pitfalls"\n* **Pure Functions (FP):** A function that always returns the same output for the same input and causes **no side effects** (does not modify outside state). This is critical in React (e.g., in reducers).\n* **Immutability:** A cornerstone of FP (and React state management). Instead of modifying an object/array, you create a new one with the necessary changes.\n',

    category: "JavaScript Core",

    explanation:

    explanation:
      "The **Lexical Environment** is a conceptual, internal object created by the JavaScript engine to manage variable scoping during code execution.\n\nIt consists of two main parts:\n1.  **Environment Record:** Stores all identifier bindings (variables, functions, and arguments) within the scope (e.g., the function scope, or block scope).\n2.  **Outer Environment Reference:** A pointer to the lexical environment of the outer scope.\n\n**How it Relates to Closures:** When a function is created, it captures the *Outer Environment Reference* from where it was defined.

This differs from class-based inheritance.\n\n### Key Concepts\n1. **`[[Prototype]]` (The Link):** Every object has an internal, hidden link to another object (its prototype). In modern JS, this is accessed via `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)` or the deprecated `obj.__proto__`.\n2. **`prototype` Property (The Blueprint):** Only function objects have a public `prototype` property. When a function is used as a constructor (`new Func()`), the `[[Prototype]]` of the *new instance* is set to point to the `Func.prototype` object.\n3. **Prototype Chain:** When trying to access a property, the engine first looks on the object itself.

      "The React rendering pipeline is split into three phases: **Trigger**, **Render**, and **Commit**. This ensures updates are batched and the DOM is only manipulated once per update cycle, maximizing efficiency.\n\n### 1. Trigger\nAn update is initiated by a component's state change (e.g., `setState`, `useState` setter, `useReducer` dispatch) or a prop change from the parent.\n\n### 2. Render (Reconciliation)\nReact performs its calculations in memory:\n* It calls the component functions (`render` method or function body).\n* It generates a new element tree (Virtual DOM).\n* It compares the **New VDOM** with the **Previous VDOM** using the **Diffing Algorithm** (Q14) to find minimal changes (the 'patch').\n* This phase can be paused or interrupted (allowing concurrent rendering).\n\n### 3. Commit\nReact applies the changes found in the Diffing phase to the actual browser DOM. This phase is synchronous and blocking, as it directly manipulates the browser's view:\n* React updates the real DOM nodes.\n* The browser performs the final paint.\n* Lifecycle effects run (`useEffect`, `componentDidMount/Update`).",

An event fired inside a portal will bubble up to the React parent, even if the DOM parent is different.",

      "Error Boundaries are **Class Components** that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.\n\nRequired Lifecycle Methods:\n* **`static getDerivedStateFromError(error)`**: Update state to show fallback UI.\n* **`componentDidCatch(error, info)`**: Log error information.",
    tips: '"Interview Tips"\n* **Limitations:** Error Boundaries **do not** catch errors in: Event handlers, Async code (setTimeout), SSR, or errors thrown in the boundary itself.\n* currently, there is **no Hook equivalent** for Error Boundaries; you must use a class component.',

  // Q101: forwardRef and useImperativeHandle
  {
    id: 101,
    title: "forwardRef and useImperativeHandle",
    category: "React Fundamentals",
    explanation:
      "**`forwardRef`**: React components do not pass the `ref` attribute to their children by default. `forwardRef` allows a component to take a `ref` passed to it and forward it down to a specific DOM node (or class component) inside it.\n\n**`useImperativeHandle`**: Customizes the instance value that is exposed to parent components when using `ref`. Instead of exposing the raw DOM node, you can expose specific methods (e.g., `focus`, `scroll`).",
    tips: '"Interview Tips"\n* **Controlled vs Uncontrolled:** Accessing DOM nodes via refs is an "escape hatch." Prefer controlled state, but use refs for focus management, media playback, or integrating with third-party DOM libraries.',
    codeString:
      "const CustomInput = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {\n  const localRef = React.useRef();\n  \n  React.useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({\n    alertHi: () => alert('Hi'),\n    focus: () => localRef.current.focus()\n  }));\n\n  return <input ref={localRef} placeholder=\"Type here\" />;\n});\n\n// Usage in Parent\n// const ref = useRef();\n// <CustomInput ref={ref} />\n// ref.current.alertHi();",

    title: "Higher-Order Components (HOC) vs Render Props",
    category: "React Fundamentals",
    explanation:
      "Before Hooks, these were the primary patterns for logic reuse.\n\n**HOC**: A function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional props/logic. (e.g., `withRouter(Component)`).\n* *Cons:* Prop collisions, wrapper hell.\n\n**Render Props**: A component with a prop (usually named `render` or `children`) that is a function. The component calls this function with its internal state. (e.g., `<Mouse render={({ x, y }) => ...} />`).\n* *Cons:* Callback hell (nesting).",
    tips: '"Interview Tips"\n* **Modern View:** **Custom Hooks** have largely replaced both patterns for logic reuse because they don\'t add nesting to the component tree. However, Render Props are still useful for pure rendering logic (like virtualization libraries).',

The source of truth is React state.\n* *Mechanism:* `value={state}` and `onChange={setState}`.\n\n**Uncontrolled Component:** The form data is handled by the **DOM** itself. The source of truth is the DOM.\n* *Mechanism:* `ref` to access values and `defaultValue` for initialization.",
    tips: '"Interview Tips"\n* **Validation:** Controlled components enable instant validation (as you type). Uncontrolled components are better for non-React integration or extremely simple forms where re-renders on every keystroke cause performance issues.',

  {

    title: "React Architecture: Fiber & Synthetic Events",
    category: "React Fundamentals",
    explanation:
      "**React Fiber:** The reconciliation engine introduced in React 16. It allows rendering to be split into chunks (**Time Slicing**), capable of pausing and prioritizing work. This enables features like Suspense and Concurrent Mode.\n\n**Synthetic Events:** React implements its own event system that wraps native browser events. This ensures consistent behavior across different browsers (cross-browser compatibility) and optimizes performance via event delegation.",
    tips: '"Interview Tips"\n* **Event Pooling:** Note that before React 17, Synthetic Events were "pooled" (nulled out) for performance. **React 17+ removed event pooling**, so you no longer need `e.persist()` to use events async.',
